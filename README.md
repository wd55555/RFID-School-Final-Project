# RFID-School-Final-Project
This python based project utilizes the SparkFun RFID starter kit to simulate RFID chips in schoolbags to alert instructors and parents if a child enters/exits a specific location. Stored data inside of a csv file (scan_log.csv), and preregistered RFID tags paired with student names inside of (rfid_database.csv) aswell. 

Note: Code does need editing for the serial_port # that is used. My device used COM5, but can range from COM1-COM5 based off information found in the device manager. Additonally, same goes with the file location that I hardcoded in.
